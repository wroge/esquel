# esquel

A package for creating SQL statements and scanning rows in Go structures without reflection. You can pronounce it however you like, but my choice is *es'kel*.

```go
go get github.com/wroge/esquel

import "github.com/wroge/esquel"
import eskel "github.com/wroge/esquel"
import sequel "github.com/wroge/esquel"
import squeal "github.com/wroge/esquel"
```
